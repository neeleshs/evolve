* Put evolver-0.1.jar and evolver.properties in to classpath

* Change evolver.properties to suit your database

* Create a package somewhere in your source tree to hold migration files

* Create either Java or SQL migration files. The SQL files should start with a number. The Java files should have the name in the following format
Revision<No>.java where <No> is the revision number. Java and SQL files can live together, as long as the revision numbers don't clash
  
* To run the migrations, run the class com.motn.evole.Evolver, with migrations, evolve-0.1.jar and evolver.properties under classpath

* See examples.xml if you need an ant target for evolve
